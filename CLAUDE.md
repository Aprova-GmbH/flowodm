Most of the basic information (development process, project structure, environment setup, testing and publishing) is covered in: `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
Follow the development process and format code before each commit.

When asked for a new feature:
- Create an issue first
- Create a feature branch from `main`
- Write code and tests
- Format code and run unit tests
- Ask the user to review and ask if the user wants to run integration tests
- After the user review and approval, prepare a pull request
